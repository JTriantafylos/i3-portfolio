				<div id="information-left">
					<h2>Interests</h2>
					<p><span style="color: #a3be8c;">###</span> As a student who was accepted into the PACE program early in my educational career I have discovered my passion for learning and school in general.</p>
					<p><span style="color: #a3be8c;">###</span> Since fifth grade I have chosen to stay in the PACE/AP program which has allowed me to receive a much more enhanced and broader education experience.</p>

					<br>

					<p><span style="color: #a3be8c;">###</span> Over my lifetime I have also found that I have a strong interest in computers and technology in general.</p>
					<p><span style="color: #a3be8c;">###</span> By spending a huge portion of my time messing around with computers I have found that I have quite the aptitude for being able to work my way around them which in turn has helped me with both work related (Freelance IT Support) and school-related (<a href="compsci.html">Computer Science</a>) tasks.</p>

					<h2>Skills</h2>
					<p><span style="color: #a3be8c;">###</span> Due to my deep interest in computers and technology in general I have, in my own opinion, became quite well versed in the subject over my lifetime.</p>
					<p><span style="color: #a3be8c;">###</span> Over the years I have become quite proficient in the hardware and software side of computers, building my first system at the age of 12 and many more systems after that, as well as setting up Windows and Linux systems more times than I could count over the past years.</p>
					<p><span style="color: #a3be8c;">###</span> These skills have helped me greatly over my lifetime and I continue to strive to build on these skills everyday.</p>
